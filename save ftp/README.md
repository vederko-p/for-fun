# save ftp
This program makes the backup of an ftp server. To use it you have to edit the
backup.py and write your host, user and password you use to connect to an
ftp server and then start this file. The only thing is I didnt foresee a case
when you dont have a permission to download some files so you can get an error in
this case.

For convenience, program will be notifying you which directory is being
downloaded now and which file was saved last.
